Background
Gridlock on road intersection due to unintelligent routing


* Everyone prefers the shortest distance route
* No. of vehicles exponentially increasing
* Capacity of roads --- CONSTANT!
* Increasing travel times
* Under-utilization of a city's road network.

Use multi-class fleets instead?

# Break a customer trip into 3 classes:
> first mile:  :
               : }}}}  Uses cycles, scooters, walking on pedestrian paths
> Last mile:   :

> Middle Mile: Covers ~90% of the trips using fast-speed cars or public transports.

Formulating the problem

- Route customer trips in a congestion-aware manner using a multi-class fleet of vehicles
- Provides optimal transit points for each trip.
- Create a social model.----------Wardrop User Equilibrium X(not this)        Wardrop System Equilibrium \/(yes this)


GIS(Geographic Information System)
It's a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displayijng data related to positions on Earth's surface.

Python GIS Libraries
1. OSMNx: 
    > Retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize OpenStreetMap street networks and other spatial data.

2. GeoPandas:
    > Extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

Edge Dataframe

-- | u | v | key | osmid | oneway | name | highway | maxspeed | length | travel_time | Location


3. NetworkX:
    > Create, manipulate, and study the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.


4. Rtree:
    > Provides advanced spatial indexing features like nearest neighbor search, intersection search


What are we going to do???????
