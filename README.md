### Abstract

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is one of the most common and effective 
methods of identifying vehicles in traffic jams and checkpoints. ANPR technology is 
used to automate checkpoints, weighing points, parking lots, car washes and gas 
stations, and to control vehicle access to company offices, industrial areas, gated 
communities, hotels and airport areas. Automatic number/license plate recognition 
involves extracting license plates from vehicles and labeling them for their basic 
identifiers.


<!-- <strike> Time is one of the most important thing in this globalized world
Even a millisecond is essential in our dynamic day-to-day life.
Within a blink of eyes, there can be a drastic change in life.

Thus in recent years, traffic congestion prediction has led to a growing research area, 
especially of machine learning of Artificial Intelligence(AI).
With the introduction of big data by stationary sensors or probe vehicle data and 
the development of new AI models in the last few decades, this research are has expanded
extensively.
Traffic congestion, especially short-term traffic congestion prediction is made by 
evaluating different traffic parameters.
Most of the researches focus on historical data in forecasting traffic congestion.
However, a few articles made real-time traffic congestion prediction.
This paper systematically summarises the existing research conducted by applying the various
methodologies of AI, notably different machine learning models.
The paper accumulates the models under respective branches of AI, and the strength and weakness of the 
models are summarised.
